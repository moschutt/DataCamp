# DataCamp class notes for R

There is 1 sub-folder for each [Data Camp](https://www.datacamp.com) course I'm either working on or have worked on.

Generally, I use R notebooks to take notes and embed work based on class examples.

No, final output files, such as .pdf or .html files, are uploaded to the repo.
